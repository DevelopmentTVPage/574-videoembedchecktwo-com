On one side the butterfly is relaxing and floating on the wind, but on the other hand he also sets with steam and fire to a fall into a low altitude. This is how it feels when Brejcha makes music.\n\nThe fourth album is exactly the description of this \"Feuerfalter\", a kind of backflash into the impressive career of Boris Brejcha. An album that deliberately shows how the artist works versatile. Times slightly floating, sometimes wild hitting the wing, always full of passion. The influences of his travelings and performances characterize his art again.\n\nThis creates a music that may be accompanied on Brejchas audience the whole day: at home, in a relaxed atmosphere or just at night, when the trip through the clubs starts.

The hot Tel Aviv duo Red Axes bring their trademark new wave sound to a tropical dimension remixing Robytek's 'Luna Africana' combining unusual melodies of bells, chimes and perc drums. The Keinemusik boss Rampa is back with a killer remix of 'Deep Musique' by Pasta Boys Feat. Osunlade, definitely another dancefloor peak time cut on Rebirth. The italian duo Modular Project add their electronic-balearic touch to the Blond:ish vocal anthem Wizard of Love, while the misterious bass producer VVV reworks another classic on the label, Crossroads by T-Polar, giving us a sublte but heavy deep and futuristic synth work. \nThe cover sleeve is a work by Emil Schult, who has created a painting especially for the Rebirth's Anniversary. Emil is known for his work with electronic music pioneers Kraftwerk.

Thats precisely why we once again got the extraordinary Edu Imbernon on board to follow up on last years outstanding Mystery Inside. On Leopard, Edu teams up with Barcelona residents Los Suruba and the vocal talent Daniel Wild to dazzling effect. The original mix kicks off the A-Side with shuffling rhythms and atmospheric pads that make way for a beautiful synth bass-line, echoing bells and Wildes sensuous voice, driven forward by a sharp snare. Striking a perfect balance between restraint and euphoria, we are invited on a dreamy musical journey that arrests both, body and soul. On the flip, things get colourful on Boy Next Doors remix of Leopard as neon disco chords lighten up a deep bass-line, while Wildes vocals are given ample room to work their magic. Last but not least, Sascha Braemer & Dan Caster create something entirely different by pitching down the vocals, replacing the originals synths with enchanting guitar loops and steely high hats. Never surrender!",

Recondite has become the artist that we've featured the most on our channel and today we're adding another track to that already impressive list. Why bother, you ask? Because we feel you need to hear this one as well.\n\nHis 'Caldera' EP seems to be a statement of his artistic progress since bursting onto the scene with 'DRGN'. The b-side on 'Caldera' is fittingly called 'DRGN2' and features elements of 'DRGN' (melody) and 'Cleric' (rhythm), yet with some newer elements. It's as if he's saying: \"I'm closing the book on that chapter now, and I'm moving forward with 'Caldera'\". Melodically it's still very mysterious and captivating, yet somehow Caldera is a little bit more accessible.\n\nOn October 16th at ADE, Recondite will be playing in the other room at HYTE Warehouse (hosted by Welcome to the Future).
